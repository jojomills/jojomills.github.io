Josephine Mills Personal Website

I created a personal website to demonstrate my programming skills to potential employers. I took in-person summer courses to stay on track after studying abroad so I do not have internship programming experience. I made this website to exemplify my coding skills and allow an employer to get to know me better than a resume can. 

I organized my website into 6 different html pages:

Home- The home page is loaded when a user clicks my website link. Includes an image of myself and a box introducing myself. 

About Me- States my goals and some facts about me with photos. 

Education- Overview of my engineering education including my university, degree earned and GPA

Skills- Displays my key skills on a bar graph ranging from some experience to proficient experience. The skills page also shows my top personal skills with icons.

Experience- Collection of my college experiences. The page loads with boxes containing an image, title, and date/initiation of experience. When the user hovers on the image, text appears over the image and goes more indepth on what I did / accomplished during the experience. 

Contact- Includes my personal contact information and also includes an array of photos. When a user hovers on one of the black and white pictures, the image zooms in slightly and displays in color. 

The 6 html page titles are visible on every page. There is also a link to my linkedin profile and a resume download at the top right of the page which allows the user to click either of these from anywhere within the website. 

---I created the website using Sublime Text---
