		<p class="title" style="font-size: 180%">A little about me</p>
			<div id="about-text">
				<p style="margin-top: 0;">I was born and raised in Anchorage, AK. I grew up fishing on the Kenai River and enjoying the beautiful Alaskan outdoors. From the midnight summer sun to the snow-covered mountains in the winter, Alaska is a very unique place to grow up.</p>
				<p>I started competitive gymnastics at a young age and transitioned to competitive cheerleading. Competing in an individual sport like gymnastics taught me discipline and determination. I spent about 25 hours in the gym training every week on top of school and traveling for competitions. When I started cheerleading, I had to alter my mind set to a team oriented sport. I learned the importance of respect and teamwork in order to be successful. Along with hours spent training, traveling was also a huge aspect of doing sports in Alaska. We competed at many national competitions winning 3 titles while I was on the team and placing 3rd in the US trials at The Cheerleading Worlds. I had to learn how to balance my life with sports, school, family and a social life. I was definitely a busy kid growing up but it shaped me to become the person I am today and taught me skills that has allowed me to succeed both personally and academically. </p>
				<p>Growing up, I excelled in STEM classes which steered me to pursue an engineering degree. Taking my first programming course my freshmen year in college sparked this curiosity and passion for coding. I loved solving problems and finding creative solutions. Nothing beats the feeling of debugging for hours and finally finding that one syntax error. I had this fascination with software development which ultimately led me to declare my major in Electrical and Computer Engineering.</p>
				<p>I like to consider myself not your "typical" engineer. My outgoing nature and extroverted personality makes me a unique candidate as a programmer. I’m not afraid to ask questions and speak up. Earning my engineering degree highlighted my knowledge in a technical sense but I bring more than just brains. I am a family oriented person and grew up with three other siblings. I was lucky enough to attend college with my other siblings which fostered a very close bond. They have made me more selfless and tough. They pushed me to be the best version of myself. I hope to use the skills I’ve gained to make a difference and continue growing as a person. </p>
